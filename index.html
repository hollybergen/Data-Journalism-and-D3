          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Poverty</h3>
          <p>We pulled census data from across the United States in 2014, comparing variables
              poverty and obesity. You can see from the chart there looks to be a trend of positive 
              correlation between these variables, meaning a correlation of higher poverty to higher
              obesity. There are of course some outliers, such as Washington, D.C. and Colorado which show
              high poverty to low obesity, or Maryland and New Hampshire which show higher obesity to 
              low poverty. The states of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, and West Virginia
              all have high obesity as well as high poverty. </p>

          <p>These results are interesting, considering that in non-industrialized nations, we would
              expect poorness and poverty to be correlated with malnutrition and hunger. However these 
              results seem to suggest that in an industrialized nation such as the U.S., healthier diets 
              come at a higher cost, and there are many cheap, available options such as fast food. </p>
